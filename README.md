# AASF-Discussion-Forum
This contains a website of discussion forum , made for an intra college web development contest called Webkriti in ABV-IIITM Gwalior.

This is a basic code of a discussion forum.
To run the website:
Download any php server, I used xampp.
create a database named mydb.
Run the localhost server and open index.php.

NOTE: This does not contain sql file for the database , which I will be uploading shortly.

I hope you enjoyed my project.
